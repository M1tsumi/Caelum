# Caelum
Clean, fast, and fully Objective-C-native library for the Discord Gateway (v10) and REST API. Built for macOS &amp; iOS projects that live in Objective-C, with zero Swift dependencies, perfect Apple-platform integration, and the polish you expect from a framework that feels like it belongs in /System/Library/Frameworks.
